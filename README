= Inequal Opportunity

ActiveRecord is a ruby ORM released with Ruby on Rails.  It has a hash syntax
for specifying SQL conditions:

  YourModel.count(:conditions => {:id => 5})
  YourModel.all(:limit => 5, :order => :created_at, :conditions => {:user_id => 5})

But this hash format lacks inequalities.  In order to generate:

  SELECT * from your_models where id <> '42';

You have to write:

  YourModel.count(:conditions => ['id <> ?', 42])

With Inequal Opportunity, you can write:

  YourModel.count(:conditions => {:id => ne(42)})

Where Object#ne wraps 42 in a ActiveRecord::Inequality::NotEqual class,
which is then used to insert the proper operator into the generated SQL.

Other supported inequalities are:

  gte()     =>      >=
  gt()      =>      >
  lte()     =>      <=
  le()      =>      <
  ne()      =>      <>
  ne(nil)   =>      IS NOT


Test coverage is real sparse right now.  And it's only been tested
on MySQL.  I also am not completely satisfied with the way I overwrite
ActiveRecord.expand_range_bind_variables, but it works.
